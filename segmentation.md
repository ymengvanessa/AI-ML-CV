Hypercolumns Representation:
- simplified explanation: convolutional neural network (CNN) normally used the output of the last layer as feature representation and the information is too coarse, while hypercolumn at a pixel is the vector of activations of all CNN units above that pixel(use convolution and upsampling),

- In a word, label density strategy is to apply active learning on unlabeled datasets by sampling on dense clusters of feature space

- feature vs label
